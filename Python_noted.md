Datatype               Description                                       Example
int              positive and negative number without decimal             1, 2, 3, 4, 5
float            positive and negative number with decimal                 1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
str              sequence of character                                    "Hello", "World", "Python"

5. # Example Here: 
# write a code to store the library  books add a library_name, total book, book name, average rating, author name, location, publisher, contact number open, close time, time and price of the book.

# This code use of input user interface :

# Challange 5: 
# Write a program that takes user input for year of birth (as a string) in the format 'YYYYâ€™ and finds the age of the person. The program should handle the case where the user enters a future year?


# Comment:
comment are text in a program that is not executed.

# Advantage  of comment :
you can describe the code in a human-readable way
Other people can read the code and understand what it does
The code is easier to maintain and modify
comment provide additional information or context to the code
the help in understanding the code and debugging the code

# Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd. Take user input for the number,perform the check, and print the result. Include comments explaining each part of the code.
